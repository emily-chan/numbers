# numbers
A bash script that prompts a user to type a positive integer and then prints all the numbers from 1 up to and including that number with the word "odd" or "even" on the same line as the number.
For example, if the user were to enter the number 5, the program would print
1 Odd
2 Even
3 Odd
4 Even
5 Odd
